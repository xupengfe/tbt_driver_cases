XmlCli Reference scripts which are based on XML Information & BIOS CLI interface protocol.
These Ref. scripts provides several capabilities such as Programming/Reading BIOS knobs,
Fetching Platform XML from target, Flashing BIOS, Fetching BIOS, Ucode read, Save & Update,
System Information, etc. These scripts are generic and platform/program independent
(as long as the BIOS on SUT BIOS supports XML CLI interface).
The scripts were tested on SVOS, ITP DAL & on systems with SV HIF card.
These scripts can be updated to work on Windows & Linux SUT's.
This check-in is the V 1.0 check-in tested across several different platforms and test enviornments.
Please let me (ashinde) know for any querries or feedback related to these scripts/interface.
let me know for more questions/clarification (amol.shinde@intel.com)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supported Interface Types:
	Legacy ITP
	ITP II
	Lauterbac
	DCI
	Simics
	SVOS
	Windows
	LINUX
	EFI Shell
	SV HIF card
	TSSA
	Offline mode (or stub mode, to enable BIOS/IFWI Editing)


Prerequisites:
	Python 2.7 S/W installed on the system.
	For running it on Windows SUT, you need to install CCB SDK (for HWAPI interface)

Common importing steps:
	Copy the Reference scripts on any folder on the system
	open Python Prompt and run following commands
		import sys
		sys.path.append(r"<Path_To_XmlCliRefScripts>")
		import XmlCli as cli

Setting Interface Type:
	Need to select the interface to indicate the scripts on which access method to use (depending on which enviournment we expect the script to operate in).
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("itpii")		# For using ITPII as interface, need to have ITP S/W & H/W installed on the system
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("svlegitp")	# For using Legacy ITP as interface, need to have Legacy ITP S/W & H/W installed on the system
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("ltb")		# For using Lauterbac as interface, need to have LTB S/W & H/W installed on the system
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("dci")		# For using dci as interface, need to have ITP & DCI S/W & H/W installed on the system

		cli.clb._setCliAccess("svos")		# For using svos as interface, need to have svos disk installed on the system
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("winssa")		# For using ssa as primary interface on Windows (recomended, uses HWAPI DLL), need to have SSA folder copied under C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\  SSA folder can be unzipped from \\bascrd101\svshare\Amol\XmlCliRefScripts\ssa.zip
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("winsdk")		# For using SDK as Windows interface (uses HWAPI DLL), need to have "Intel® CCG Platform Tools SDK" installed on the system.
							# Find the SDK from \\bascrd101\svshare\amol\XmlCliRefScripts\Intel® CCG Platform Tools SDK.zip
							# Latest SDK that fixes the BSOD is under \\bascrd101\svshare\Amol\XmlCliRefScripts\CCBSDK_1.2.1002.zip
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("winrwe")		# For using RW.exe as Windows interface (slow, least recomended)
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("linux")		# For using linux as interface, need to open Python Prompt in root permissions.
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("uefi")		# For using EFI SHELL as interface, need to have EFI SHELL's Python Interpretor on the system
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("svhif")		# For using SV Host Interface Card (Dishon, Kfir) as interface, need to have Sv HIF card plugged on the system and Sv Mode innitialized.

Running popular comands:
	After initializing the desired interface, the use may run following commands.
	If the commands return 0, it means the operation was successfull, else there was an error.

	Std import steps:
		import sys
		sys.path.append(r"<Path_To_XmlCliRefScripts>")
		import XmlCli as cli
		cli.clb._setCliAccess("itpii")		# Set desired Interface (for example itpii)

	# Step to check XmlCli capability on current System, Please ensure to rename the EnableXmlCli.pyc_ under xmlcli\tools folder back to EnableXmlCli.pyc
		cli.clb.ConfXmlCli()	# Check if XmlCli is supported &/ Enabled on the current system.
					# If it returns Value 0 it means XmlCli is already supported & enabled.
					# If it returns value 2 then it means XmlCli is supported but was not enabled, the script has now enabled it and SUT needs reboot to make use of XmlCli.
					# If it returns value 1 then it means XmlCli is not supported on the current BIOS or the System BIOS has not completed Boot.

	# Usage Instructions to run Python.efi from EFI shell:
		Download and unzip the Python EFI Package from \\bascrd101\svshare\amol\XmlCliRefScripts\PythonEFI_v1.2.7z
		Copy EFI folder to USB Stick
		Insert USB Stick to the DUT (Device Under Test)
		Boot to EFI shell
		If USB Stick is detected as FS0: file system Type FS0: on the shell prompt to get FS0:> prompt string on the shell
		From the shell prompt issue the following command "Python.efi -$"     -  to get into interactive mode of interpreter
		if you want to run any script from file say MyScript.py, Copy the script to USB Stick run the following command "Python.efi <pathToScriptDirectoryonUSBStick>\MyScript.py"

		#To enable XmlCli Python reference Scripts support on EFI Shell:
			In the above steps please following as an aditional step.
			Copy XmlCli reference Scripts folder under EFI folder of the USB Stick
			you can now import the XmlCli scripts and make use of it as usual, please note the "import XmlCli as cli" will automatically detect the UEFI as interface Type.
